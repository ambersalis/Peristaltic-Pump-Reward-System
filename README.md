- Some way of routing power to/driving the motor:
	- [Option 1] L293D [ http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293d.pdf ]
	- [Option 2: Arduino Only] Seeed Studio Motor Shield (or other shield)
	- [Option 3: Raspberry Pi Only] Gertboard 
	- [Option 4] Power Transistor
- [Optional] Momentary Push Button/Switch for manual fluid delivery
- [Optional] Something to house the components (I like OpenBeam or MakerSlide)
