A basic equipment list can be found below, but the current FAQ is hosted here: https://kelpforest.org/projects/peristalticpump/index.html

- Peristaltic Liquid Pump (12VDC / 300mA) with Silicone Tubing (max flow 100mL/min) [ http://www.adafruit.com/products/1150 ]
- 12VDC Adapter (old D-Link wall adapter in my case) to power the motor
- Programmable device to control motor activity:
- - - - [Option 1] Raspberry Pi Model B [ http://www.newark.com/jsp/search/productdetail.jsp?sku=43W5302 ]
- - - - [Option 2] Arduino Uno (Or Similar) [ http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno ]
- - - - [Option 3] Your alternative controller of choice.
- Some way of routing power to/driving the motor:
- - - - [Option 1] L293D [ http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293d.pdf ; http://www.adafruit.com/products/807 ]
- - - - [Option 2: Arduino Only] Seeed Studio Motor Shield (or any motor shield that fits your Arduino) [ http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/motor-shield-p-913.html ]
- - - - [Option 3: Raspberry Pi Only] Gertboard [ http://www.newark.com/jsp/search/productdetail.jsp?sku=46W9829 ]
- - - - [Option 4] Power Transistor
- [Optional] Momentary Push Button/Switch for manual fluid delivery
- [Optional] Something to house the components (I like OpenBeam or MakerSlide)
